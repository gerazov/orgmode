Thanks to
========================================
* `@dhruvasagar <https://github.com/dhruvasagar>`_ and his `vim-dotoo <https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-dotoo>`_ plugin
  that got me started using orgmode. Without him this plugin would not happen.
* `@milisims <https://github.com/milisims>`_ for writing a tree-sitter parser for org
* `vim-orgmode <https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode>`_ for some parts of the code (mostly syntax)
