**If you built a plugin please add "orgmode-nvim" topic to it.**

**NOTE**: None of the Emacs Orgmode plugins will be built into orgmode.nvim.
Anything that's a separate plugin in Emacs Orgmode should be a separate plugin in here.
Point of this plugin is to provide functionality that's built into Emacs Orgmode core,
and a good foundation for external plugins.

If you want to build a plugin, post suggestions and improvements on `Plugins infrastructure <https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/issues/26>`_
issue.
